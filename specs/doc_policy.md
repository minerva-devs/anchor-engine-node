# Documentation Policy (Root Coda)

**Status:** Active | **Authority:** Human-Locked

## Core Philosophy
1. **Code is King:** Code is the only source of truth. Documentation is a map, not the territory.
2. **Visuals over Text:** Prefer Mermaid diagrams to paragraphs.
3. **Brevity:** Text sections must be <500 characters.
4. **Pain into Patterns:** Every major bug must become a Standard.

## Structure

### 1. The Blueprint (`specs/spec.md`)
*   **Role:** The single architectural source of truth.
*   **Format:** "Visual Monolith".
*   **Content:** High-level diagrams (Kernel, Memory, Logic, Bridge). No deep implementation details.

### 2. The Tracker (`specs/tasks.md`)
*   **Role:** Current work queue.
*   **Format:** Checklist.
*   **Maintenance:** Updated by Agents after every major task.

### 3. The Roadmap (`specs/plan.md`)
*   **Role:** Strategic vision.
*   **Format:** Phased goals.

### 4. Standards (`specs/standards/*.md`)
*   **Role:** Institutional Memory (The "Laws" of the codebase).
*   **Trigger:** Created after any bug that took >1 hour to fix OR any systemic improvement that affects multiple components.
*   **Format:** "The Triangle of Pain"
    1.  **What Happened:** The specific failure mode (e.g., "Bridge crashed on start").
    2.  **The Cost:** The impact (e.g., "3 hours debugging Unicode errors").
    3.  **The Rule:** The permanent constraint (e.g., "Force UTF-8 encoding on Windows stdout").

### 5. Local Context (`*/README.md`)
*   **Role:** Directory-specific context.
*   **Limit:** 1 sentence explaining the folder's purpose.

### 6. System-Wide Standards
*   **Universal Logging:** All system components must route logs to the central log collection system (Standard 013)
*   **Single Source of Truth:** The log viewer at `/log-viewer.html` is the single point for all system diagnostics
*   **Async Best Practices:** All async/await operations must follow proper patterns for FastAPI integration (Standard 014)
*   **Browser Control Center:** All primary operations must be accessible through unified browser interface (Standard 015)

## LLM Protocol
1. **Read-First:** Always read `specs/spec.md` AND `specs/standards/` before coding.
2. **Drafting:** When asked to document, produce **Mermaid diagrams** and short summaries.
3. **Editing:** Do not modify `specs/doc_policy.md` or `specs/spec.md` structure unless explicitly instructed.
4. **Archival:** Move stale docs to `archive/` immediately.
5. **Enforcement:** If a solution violates a Standard, reject it immediately.
6. **Standards Evolution:** New standards should follow the "Triangle of Pain" format and be numbered sequentially (001, 002, etc.).
7. **Cross-Reference:** When creating new standards, reference related existing standards to maintain consistency.
8. **Logging Standard:** All scripts must output logs to the logs directory with automatic truncation after 5k lines or 10k chars, and must run in detached mode for LLM models to prevent blocking operations.
