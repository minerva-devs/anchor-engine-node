### 🔒 CodeQL Security Audit Summary (April 12, 2026)
**Total Alerts Analyzed:** ~206 from CodeQL tool
**Final Assessment:** LOW severity overall — approximately **85-90% of flagged alerts are either false positives or already mitigated through existing validation layers**

#### Verification Summary Table

| Category | Alerts Flagged | False Positives | Real Issues Found |
|----------------------|------------------|----------|--------|
| Critical Dependencies (axios, handlebars) | ~30+ | ~95% detected | None - internal-only usage |
| Path Traversal Attacks (#96-#101, #93-#94) | ~15+ | ~100% detected (all have validation) | None - fully mitigated via `validatePathSafety()` and whitelist regexes |
| Loop Bound/Rate Limiting (#47, #72, #107) | ~8+ | ~100% detected (bounded operations) | None - fully mitigated with capped values (max 16 threads, default batch size 20) |
| Backup Paths (4-6 alerts) | 4-6 | ~100% detected (path.join() safety) | None - fully mitigated through proper path construction |

#### Alert Categorized Findings

**1. False Positives (CodeQL doesn't consider existing validation layers):**

| Alert Category | Count | Status |
|------------------|--------|----------|
| **Critical Dependencies** (axios, handlebars) | ~30+ | CodeQL flags npm-lock.yaml files without examining actual usage in source code — these are internal-only dependencies with no user-facing template rendering |
| **Path Traversal** (#96-#101, #93-#94) | 12+ | Already-mitigated via `validatePathSafety()` utility function and whitelist regex `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/.test(name)` for snapshot names |
| **Loop Bound Injection** (#47, #72, #107) | 8+ | Already-safe — bounded batch sizes (default: 20), memory-aware processing with capped values (max 16 threads) |

**2. Already Mitigated Through Proper Code Patterns:**

- **Path Traversal Prevention:** Whitelist regexes validate all user-supplied identifiers
- **Rate Limiting Already Implemented:** `express-rate-limit` middleware on `/v1/*`
- **Backup Path Safety:** Uses `path.join()` which prevents traversal

**3. Remaining High-Severity Items (Minor Package Upgrades Recommended):**

| Recommendation | Current | Action Required |
|------------------|--------|------------------|
| **Axios** (if used externally) | axios@1.13.5 in lockfiles | Upgrade to 1.7.9+ if any external API calls use it |
| **Handlebars.js** (internal-only) | Already not a major dependency for user-facing templates | No action required since only used internally |

#### Security Standards Reference

The following standards already provide robust mitigation:

| Standard | Description | Implementation Status |
|------------------|--------|----------|
| **Standard 025** | Path Traversal Prevention | ✅ Complete — `validatePathSafety()` utility, whitelist regexes applied to all user inputs |
| **Standard 130** | SQL Injection Prevention (from changelog) | ✅ Parameterized queries throughout codebase |
| **Standard 023** | Authentication Bypass Prevention | ✅ Complete — test endpoints audit done |
| **Standard 024** | API Key Strength Validation | ✅ Complete — enhanced validation (32-128 chars, mixed case+digits) |

#### Conclusion

The anchor-engine-node repository is **security-conscious** with robust validation, bounds checking, and input sanitization already implemented throughout its codebase. Most "vulnerabilities" flagged by automated tools like CodeQL can be safely ignored when the developer has already implemented proper defensive coding practices through:
- Input whitelisting (whitelist regexes)
- Path validation utilities (`validatePathSafety()`)
- Bounded operations (never infinite loops)
- Rate limiting middleware (`express-rate-limit`)
- Proper error handling and logging

**Severity Classification:** LOW (after investigation)
**Root Cause:** "Most CodeQL flags are false positives or already mitigated through existing validation layers"
**Reduction:** "Approximately 85-90% of flagged alerts are either false positives or ALREADY-BEEN-MITIGATED"

#### Code Analysis Enhancement (Deferred)
**Goal:** Deep code understanding via AST-based retrieval

- [ ] AST pointer support - Link atoms to source code locations
- [ ] Semantic code search - Query by code structure, not just keywords
- [ ] Import/export graph edges - Visualize relationships between modules
- [ ] Type-aware retrieval - Leverage TypeScript types for better context

#### Advanced RAG Features (Deferred)
**Goal:** Enterprise-grade retrieval capabilities

- [ ] Backup & restore system - Automated snapshots of knowledge base
- [ ] Rolling context slicer (middle-out) - Optimize context window usage
- [ ] Live context visualizer (RAG IDE) - Real-time view of active context
- [ ] Provenance bias controls - Track and prioritize source contributions

#### Ablation Studies & Testing (Deferred)
**Goal:** Validate design decisions through systematic experimentation

- [ ] Ablation study results - Measure impact of individual features on performance
- [ ] Cross-platform CI testing matrix - Test across Windows, macOS, Linux environments

### 🚧 Current Pain Points (Observed & Documented)

| Pain Point | Impact | Status |
|------------|--------|--------|
| **Startup is manual and fragile** — requires terminal, Node.js, npm, remembering commands | Non‑developers can't use it; even you dread starting it | 🟡 Medium Priority |
| **No system tray / background service** — engine ties up a terminal window | Feels like a dev tool, not a consumer app | 🔴 High Priority |
| **No onboarding wizard** — user must manually add GitHub repos or paths via config/API | First‑run experience is empty and confusing | 🟡 Medium Priority |
| **No visual feedback during ingestion** — progress only in logs/terminal | User doesn't know if working or stuck | 🟢 Low Priority |
| **No one‑click installer** — requires cloning repo, npm install, environment setup | Huge barrier to entry | 🔴 High Priority |
| **No auto‑start with OS** — must be manually launched after reboot | Memory only available when remembered | 🟡 Medium Priority |

## 🧪 Test Suite Audit (May 2026)

**Trigger:** AST parser made async (`parseCodeStructure` → `Promise<CodeStructure | null>`), plus pre-existing test bugs.
**Run:** `pnpm test:all` or `vitest run --config engine/vitest.config.ts`
**Result:** 100% pass rate achieved after vitest migration and assertion fixes

### May 2026 — Test Consolidation & Housekeeping (COMPLETED)

**Goal:** Clean up test chaos, consolidate into a single orchestration point, reduce file count.

- [x] **Consolidate test files** — All tests under `engine/tests/` as `.test.ts` files ✅ DONE
- [x] **Simplify `package.json` test scripts** — `pnpm test` (all), `pnpm test:unit`, `pnpm test:integration`, `pnpm test:bench` ✅ DONE
- [x] **Fix remaining failing tests** — 100% pass rate achieved ✅ DONE
- [x] **Migrate all tests to vitest** ✅ DONE

### May 2026 — Runtime Data Cleanup (COMPLETED)

**Goal:** Ensure all runtime data lives in `~/.anchor/`, keep project directory clean.

- [x] **Verify `~/.anchor/` path configured** — All paths resolve via `engine/src/config/paths.ts` ✅ DONE
- [x] **Update `.gitignore`** — `~/.anchor/` excluded, project-local runtime data excluded ✅ DONE
- [x] **Clean up stale data from project root** — All 16 stale directories inside `engine/` removed ✅ DONE
- [x] **Verify `user_settings.json.template` generates `user_settings.json` at `$HOME/.anchor/`** ✅ DONE

### May 2026 — WASM Binary Packaging Plan

**Goal:** Evaluate packaging personal WASM modules as prebuilt binaries to cut npm out of the loop.

- [ ] **Audit WASM dependencies** — List all `@rbalchii/*-wasm` packages, assess build complexity
- [ ] **Evaluate direct `.wasm` loading** — Can we ship `.wasm` files in `node_modules` and load them via `fetch()` or `WebAssembly.instantiate()`?
- [ ] **Evaluate `node-addon-api` + `.node` binaries** — For C++ modules, ship precompiled binaries per platform
- [ ] **Document tradeoffs** — npm registry vs direct loading: versioning, caching, CI, size
- [ ] **Prototype one module** — Pick the smallest WASM module and test direct loading

### May 2026 — DB Schema Clarification

**Goal:** Formalize the database schema now that the development wave has settled.

- [ ] **Audit all SQL tables** — Document every table, column, index, and their purpose
- [ ] **Create schema migration file** — `engine/src/core/schema-migration.sql` with all `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statements
- [ ] **Remove redundant ALTER TABLE** — Migrate any `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` from `db.ts` into the migration file
- [ ] **Add schema version tracking** — Track schema version in a `schema_version` table or similar
- [ ] **Document schema** — Add to `docs/` or `specs/` as a reference
