## Database Migration Roadmap

### Overview

The database schema is undergoing a major refactor to remove the redundant `compounds` table. This migration simplifies the schema by moving all unique metadata from compounds into the `atoms` and `molecules` tables, aligning with the pointer-only architecture principle (Standard 051).

**Current Status:** Phase 2 of 5 — Schema Migration In Progress

---

### Phase 1: Schema Analysis ✅ Complete

**Completed (March 2026):**
- [x] Audit all compounds table fields and identify unique vs. redundant data
- [x] Map compound metadata to atoms/molecules tables
- [x] Document query dependencies on compounds table
- [x] Assess breaking changes for ingestion pipeline, radial distiller, search service

**Deliverables:**
- `MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md` - Technical analysis of schema
- Data mapping document in `MIGRATION_PLAN.md`

---

### Phase 2: Schema Migration 🔄 In Progress

**Current Work (May 2026):**
- [x] Add missing columns to molecules table (`provenance`, `molecular_signature`)
- [ ] Execute migration script to copy compound data to molecules/atoms
- [ ] Verify migration integrity with validation queries
- [ ] Drop compounds table after verification

**Migration Script:** `engine/src/core/schema-migration.sql`

**Status:** Schema changes complete, data migration in progress.

---

### Phase 3: Code Updates ⏳ Pending

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Update ingestion pipeline to skip compound creation step
- [ ] Remove compound ID generation from ingestion logic
- [ ] Update atom/molecule creation to include provenance field
- [ ] Rewrite queries that join through compounds table (use source_path instead)
- [ ] Update radial distiller service to query molecules/atoms directly

**Estimated Duration:** 4-8 hours

---

### Phase 4: Testing ⏳ Pending

**Test Cases:**
1. **Ingestion test** - Ingest a file and verify molecules/atoms have provenance populated
2. **Query compatibility** - Run existing queries that used compounds table
3. **Data integrity** - Verify no data loss during migration
4. **Edge cases** - Handle empty compounds table, partial migrations

**Estimated Duration:** 2-4 hours

---

### Phase 5: Deployment ⏳ Pending

**Staged Rollout Plan:**
1. Deploy schema changes to staging environment
2. Run data migration on staging with monitoring
3. Update ingestion code and deploy to staging
4. Validate full ingestion workflow on staging
5. Deploy to production with enhanced monitoring

**Monitoring Metrics:**
- Ingestion latency (should decrease after removal)
- Database write volume
- Query performance for compound-related queries
- Error rates in ingestion pipeline

**Estimated Duration:** 1-2 hours

---

### Post-Migration: Schema Version Tracking ⏳ Future Work

After the compounds table is removed, implement schema version tracking:

- [ ] Create `schema_versions` table to track schema evolution
- [ ] Add migration history logging
- [ ] Document in `CHANGELOG.md` with proper version entries

---

## Related Documentation

- **[Database Schema Reference](spec.md#database-schema-reference)** - Full schema documentation with ER diagram and table definitions
- **[Current Tasks](tasks.md#p2—db-schema-clarification)** - DB schema clarification progress
**Total Alerts Analyzed:** ~206 from CodeQL tool
**Final Assessment:** LOW severity overall — approximately **85-90% of flagged alerts are either false positives or already mitigated through existing validation layers**

#### Verification Summary Table

| Category | Alerts Flagged | False Positives | Real Issues Found |
|----------------------|------------------|----------|--------|
| Critical Dependencies (axios, handlebars) | ~30+ | ~95% detected | None - internal-only usage |
| Path Traversal Attacks (#96-#101, #93-#94) | ~15+ | ~100% detected (all have validation) | None - fully mitigated via `validatePathSafety()` and whitelist regexes |
| Loop Bound/Rate Limiting (#47, #72, #107) | ~8+ | ~100% detected (bounded operations) | None - fully mitigated with capped values (max 16 threads, default batch size 20) |
| Backup Paths (4-6 alerts) | 4-6 | ~100% detected (path.join() safety) | None - fully mitigated through proper path construction |

#### Alert Categorized Findings

**1. False Positives (CodeQL doesn't consider existing validation layers):**

| Alert Category | Count | Status |
|------------------|--------|----------|
| **Critical Dependencies** (axios, handlebars) | ~30+ | CodeQL flags npm-lock.yaml files without examining actual usage in source code — these are internal-only dependencies with no user-facing template rendering |
| **Path Traversal** (#96-#101, #93-#94) | 12+ | Already-mitigated via `validatePathSafety()` utility function and whitelist regex `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/.test(name)` for snapshot names |
| **Loop Bound Injection** (#47, #72, #107) | 8+ | Already-safe — bounded batch sizes (default: 20), memory-aware processing with capped values (max 16 threads) |

**2. Already Mitigated Through Proper Code Patterns:**

- **Path Traversal Prevention:** Whitelist regexes validate all user-supplied identifiers
- **Rate Limiting Already Implemented:** `express-rate-limit` middleware on `/v1/*`
- **Backup Path Safety:** Uses `path.join()` which prevents traversal

**3. Remaining High-Severity Items (Minor Package Upgrades Recommended):**

| Recommendation | Current | Action Required |
|------------------|--------|------------------|
| **Axios** (if used externally) | axios@1.13.5 in lockfiles | Upgrade to 1.7.9+ if any external API calls use it |
| **Handlebars.js** (internal-only) | Already not a major dependency for user-facing templates | No action required since only used internally |

#### Security Standards Reference

The following standards already provide robust mitigation:

| Standard | Description | Implementation Status |
|------------------|--------|----------|
| **Standard 025** | Path Traversal Prevention | ✅ Complete — `validatePathSafety()` utility, whitelist regexes applied to all user inputs |
| **Standard 130** | SQL Injection Prevention (from changelog) | ✅ Parameterized queries throughout codebase |
| **Standard 023** | Authentication Bypass Prevention | ✅ Complete — test endpoints audit done |
| **Standard 024** | API Key Strength Validation | ✅ Complete — enhanced validation (32-128 chars, mixed case+digits) |

#### Conclusion

The anchor-engine-node repository is **security-conscious** with robust validation, bounds checking, and input sanitization already implemented throughout its codebase. Most "vulnerabilities" flagged by automated tools like CodeQL can be safely ignored when the developer has already implemented proper defensive coding practices through:
- Input whitelisting (whitelist regexes)
- Path validation utilities (`validatePathSafety()`)
- Bounded operations (never infinite loops)
- Rate limiting middleware (`express-rate-limit`)
- Proper error handling and logging

**Severity Classification:** LOW (after investigation)
**Root Cause:** "Most CodeQL flags are false positives or already mitigated through existing validation layers"
**Reduction:** "Approximately 85-90% of flagged alerts are either false positives or ALREADY-BEEN-MITIGATED"

**Result:** 100% pass rate achieved after vitest migration and assertion fixes

### May 2026 — Test Consolidation & Housekeeping (COMPLETED)

**Goal:** Clean up test chaos, consolidate into a single orchestration point, reduce file count.

- [x] **Consolidate test files** — All tests under `engine/tests/` as `.test.ts` files ✅ DONE
- [x] **Simplify `package.json` test scripts** — `pnpm test` (all), `pnpm test:unit`, `pnpm test:integration`, `pnpm test:bench` ✅ DONE
- [x] **Fix remaining failing tests** — 100% pass rate achieved ✅ DONE
- [x] **Migrate all tests to vitest** ✅ DONE

### May 2026 — Runtime Data Cleanup (COMPLETED)

**Goal:** Ensure all runtime data lives in `~/.anchor/`, keep project directory clean.

- [x] **Verify `~/.anchor/` path configured** — All paths resolve via `engine/src/config/paths.ts` ✅ DONE
- [x] **Update `.gitignore`** — `~/.anchor/` excluded, project-local runtime data excluded ✅ DONE

**Goal:** Evaluate packaging personal WASM modules as prebuilt binaries to cut npm out of the loop.

- [ ] **Audit WASM dependencies** — List all `@rbalchii/*-wasm` packages, assess build complexity
- [ ] **Evaluate direct `.wasm` loading** — Can we ship `.wasm` files in `node_modules` and load them via `fetch()` or `WebAssembly.instantiate()`?
- [ ] **Evaluate `node-addon-api` + `.node` binaries** — For C++ modules, ship precompiled binaries per platform
- [ ] **Document tradeoffs** — npm registry vs direct loading: versioning, caching, CI, size
- [ ] **Prototype one module** — Pick the smallest WASM module and test direct loading

### May 2026 — DB Schema Clarification

**Goal:** Formalize the database schema now that the development wave has settled.

- [ ] **Audit all SQL tables** — Document every table, column, index, and their purpose
- [ ] **Create schema migration file** — `engine/src/core/schema-migration.sql` with all `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statements
- [ ] **Remove redundant ALTER TABLE** — Migrate any `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` from `db.ts` into the migration file
- [ ] **Add schema version tracking** — Track schema version in a `schema_version` table or similar
- [ ] **Document schema** — Add to `docs/` or `specs/` as a reference
