# Anchor Engine ⚓

**Deterministic semantic memory for local‑first AI systems**

Anchor Engine is a semantic memory layer — not an agent framework, not a vector database, and not a cloud service.

It's a deterministic, explainable, CPU‑only system for storing and retrieving long‑term memory for AI agents.

It replaces embeddings with a physics‑inspired graph algorithm (STAR) that retrieves context using structure, time, and meaning — not dense vectors.

## Why This Exists

Most AI memory systems today assume:

- GPU‑heavy vector search
- Probabilistic retrieval
- Cloud dependence
- Opaque similarity metrics

I kept running into the same problem:
> I needed a memory system that behaved like a mind, not a search engine.

Anchor Engine is built around three principles:

1. **Determinism** — same query → same result
2. **Explainability** — every retrieval comes with provenance
3. **Local sovereignty** — your data stays on your machine

This project grew out of months of building agents that needed reliable memory — and discovering that existing tools weren't designed for that job.

## What Anchor Engine Is

A semantic memory layer that provides:

- Deterministic retrieval
- Graph‑based semantics
- Temporal decay
- Provenance receipts
- CPU‑only performance (<1GB RAM)
- Local‑first architecture

Use it as:

- A drop‑in replacement for embeddings/vector DBs
- A memory backend for MCP‑compatible agents (Claude, Cursor, Qwen Code)
- A personal knowledge system for long‑term projects

## What Anchor Engine Is Not

❌ An agent framework  
❌ A cloud service  
❌ A probabilistic vector search engine  
❌ A tool that stores your data anywhere except your machine

## Architecture & Technology Stack ⚡

### Native Modules (Rust WASM)

Anchor Engine uses Rust-compiled WebAssembly modules for performance-critical operations. This eliminates the need for native compilation and provides universal platform support.

**Published Packages:**

| Package | Purpose | Version |
|---------|---------|---------|
| @rbalchii/anchor-fingerprint-wasm | Content fingerprinting (MD5, SHA256) | 1.0.0+ |
| @rbalchii/anchor-atomizer-wasm | Text atomization & entity extraction | 1.0.0+ |
| @rbalchii/anchor-keyextract-wasm | Key-value extraction from text | 1.0.0+ |
| @rbalchii/anchor-tagwalker-wasm | Semantic tag traversal | 1.0.0+ |

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Zero native compilation required (works on Windows ARM64, macOS, Linux)
- ✅ 97% smaller binary size (~35KB WASM vs ~1.2MB C++ DLLs)
- ✅ 10x faster module loading
- ✅ Universal platform support

> Note: The older C++ native modules (`engine/src/native/` directory) have been deprecated and removed in favor of these Rust WASM packages. See `engine/src/README.md` for full architectural details.

### QwenPaw Agent Configuration Protection 🔒

To protect sensitive QwenPaw agent configuration files from being accidentally committed to the repository, the following files are now gitignored:

- `BOOTSTRAP.md`
- `MEMORY.md`
- `PROFILE.md`
- `SOUL.md`
- `AGENTS.md`

These files may contain private information and should never be shared. The `.gitignore` has been updated to prevent accidental commits of these sensitive configuration files.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RSBalchII/anchor-engine-node
cd anchor-engine-node
./install.sh   # or install-macos.sh / install.ps1
pnpm start
```

Open: http://localhost

### Try It Instantly

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3160/v1/memory/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "my first memory", "token_budget": 2048}'
```

**Sample Response:**
```json
{
  "atoms": [...],
  "provenance": [{"atom_id": "abc123", "link_reason": "2 shared tags: #memory, #first"}]
}
```

## How It Works (High‑Level)

### 1. Content lives on disk, not in the database

The database stores pointers only:

- file path
- byte offsets
- tags
- timestamps
- provenance

All content is read directly from disk. This keeps RAM low and makes the DB disposable.

### 2. Retrieval uses the STAR algorithm

**STAR = Semantic Temporal Associative Retrieval**

It combines:

- **Semantic gravity** (shared tags × hop distance)
- **Temporal decay** (recent memories pull harder)
- **Structural gravity** (SimHash proximity)

The scoring equation is deterministic and explainable. Every result includes a receipt showing why it was retrieved.

### 3. The engine rebuilds itself on startup

Your data lives in:

- `notebook/inbox/` (trusted, high‑weight)
- `notebook/external-inbox/` (external, normal weight)

The engine mirrors and indexes these on launch.

## MCP Integration

Anchor Engine can run as an MCP server, giving any MCP‑compatible agent persistent memory.

**Available tools:**

- `/anchor_query` — semantic search
- `/anchor_distill` — session distillation
- `/anchor_illuminate` — graph traversal
- `/anchor_read_file` — byte‑range file reads
- `/anchor_ingest_text` — opt‑in write operations

**Works with:**

- Claude Desktop
- Cursor
- Qwen Code

### Example Query

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/v1/memory/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What did we decide about OAuth?",
    "token_budget": 2048
  }'
```

**Returns:**

- matched atoms
- provenance
- hop distance
- temporal weighting
- byte‑range pointers

## Security Posture

Anchor Engine is designed for local‑first, offline use.

**Security features include:**

- Path traversal prevention
- API key authentication
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Zero-copy deduplication
- Disposable ephemeral DB
- No cloud dependencies

A full CodeQL audit (April 2026) found no unmitigated high‑severity issues.

## Benchmarks

**Dataset:** 91MB chat history (~25M tokens)

- Ingestion: 178 seconds
- Search p95: <200ms
- Idle memory: ~600MB
- Restore: 281k atoms in 13.8 minutes

**Hardware:** consumer laptop, no GPU.

## Why "Anchor"?

> Drop a query into your memory graph.
> It sinks to the semantic bottom.
> The chain plays out to your chosen radius.
> What you retrieve is what's relevant — nothing more, nothing less.
>
> Same anchor, same spot, same result.
