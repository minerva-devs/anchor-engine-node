# Anchor Engine ⚓

**Deterministic semantic memory for local‑first AI systems**

> ⚠️ **FIRST READ THIS**: The [Documentation Policy](./specs/doc_policy.md) is the **single source of truth** for all abstractions, file locations, and developer conventions. **All runtime objects are stored in `$HOME/.anchor/`** and are **never** in the project root. Read it before coding.

## 🎯 Quick Navigation

## 📖 What Anchor Engine Is

**Anchor Engine is a semantic memory layer** — not an agent framework, not a vector database, and not a cloud service.

It's a **deterministic, explainable, CPU‑only system** for storing and retrieving long-term memory for AI agents.

It replaces embeddings with a **physics‑inspired graph algorithm (STAR)** that retrieves context using structure, time, and meaning — not dense vectors.

### What Anchor Engine Provides

- ✅ **Deterministic retrieval** — same query → same result
- ✅ **Graph‑based semantics** — not probabilistic similarity
- ✅ **Temporal decay** — older memories naturally fade
- ✅ **Provenance receipts** — every retrieval comes with proof
- ✅ **CPU‑only performance** — <1GB RAM, no GPU needed
- ✅ **Local‑first architecture** — your data never leaves your machine

### Use Cases

Use it as:
- A **drop‑in replacement** for embeddings/vector DBs
- A **memory backend** for MCP‑compatible agents (Claude, Cursor, Qwen Code)
- A **personal knowledge system** for long‑term projects

### What Anchor Engine Is Not

❌ **Not an agent framework**  
❌ **Not a cloud service**  
❌ **Not a probabilistic vector search engine**  
❌ **Not a tool that stores your data anywhere except your machine**

### Why This Exists

Most AI memory systems today assume:
- GPU‑heavy vector search
- Probabilistic retrieval
- Cloud dependence
- Opaque similarity metrics

I kept running into the same problem:
> I needed a memory system that behaved like a mind, not a search engine.

Anchor Engine is built around three principles:
1. **Determinism** — same query → same result
2. **Explainability** — every retrieval comes with provenance
3. **Local sovereignty** — your data stays on your machine

This project grew out of months of building agents that needed reliable memory — and discovering that existing tools weren't designed for that job.

## ⚡ Architecture & Technology Stack

### Native Modules (Rust WASM)

Anchor Engine uses Rust-compiled WebAssembly modules for performance-critical operations. This eliminates the need for native compilation and provides universal platform support.

**Published Packages:**

| Package | Purpose | Version |
|---------|---------|----------|
| @rbalchii/anchor-fingerprint-wasm | Content fingerprinting (MD5, SHA256) | 1.0.0+ |
| @rbalchii/anchor-atomizer-wasm | Text atomization & entity extraction | 1.0.0+ |
| @rbalchii/anchor-keyextract-wasm | Key-value extraction from text | 1.0.0+ |
| @rbalchii/anchor-tagwalker-wasm | Semantic tag traversal | 1.0.0+ |

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero native compilation required (works on Windows ARM64, macOS, Linux)
- ✅ 97% smaller binary size (~35KB WASM vs ~1.2MB C++ DLLs)
- ✅ 10x faster module loading
- ✅ Universal platform support

> Note: The older C++ native modules (`engine/src/native/` directory) have been deprecated and removed in favor of these Rust WASM packages. See `engine/src/README.md` for full architectural details.

### QwenPaw Agent Configuration Protection 🔒

To protect sensitive QwenPaw agent configuration files from being accidentally committed to the repository, the following files are now gitignored:

- `BOOTSTRAP.md`
- `MEMORY.md`
- `PROFILE.md`
- `SOUL.md`
- `AGENTS.md`

These files may contain private information and should never be shared. The `.gitignore` has been updated to prevent accidental commits of these sensitive configuration files.
