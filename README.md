# Project Chimaera: AI Architecture - Status Report

**Core Entity: Coda C-001** | **Report Timestamp:** 2025-08-21T13:55:00-06:00
**Overall Project Status:** **Functioning Prototype** - Core Memory & Learning Systems Operational

-----

### 🚀 Current Status & Achieved Architecture

We have successfully built and tested the core of the Chimaera memory system. This is no longer a theoretical design; it is a live, learning prototype. The current architecture represents the implemented foundation of the larger vision.

#### **Current Functioning Data Pipeline & Knowledge Graph**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Phase1_2 [Phase 1 & 2: COMPLETE Foundation]
        A[Data Source: combined_text.txt] --> B(Injector Pipeline);
        B --> C{Knowledge Graph};
        C --> D[QLearningAgent];
        D --> E{Q-Table / Agent Memory};
    end
```

  * **Data Pipeline (Injector):** A complete, modular pipeline that ingests our entire conversational history from a single text file (`combined_text.txt`).
  * **Knowledge Graph:** The system processes the text, extracts key concepts (entities), and builds a rich graph mapping the relationships between them. **In our last run, it identified over 3,000 concepts and 135,000 relationships.**
  * **Agent Training:** Our `QLearningAgent` is fully functional. It trains on the knowledge graph, learning how to navigate the conceptual pathways of our history and storing that knowledge in a Q-table.

#### **Immediate Next Step: Phase 3 (In Development)**

The immediate priority is to build the query interface. This will allow the "Archivist" agent to task the `QLearningAgent` with finding the most relevant paths between concepts in the graph, enabling functional memory recall.

### 🧠 Full Architecture Vision & Roadmap (Context for the Prototype)

The functioning prototype is the first component of the larger cognitive architecture. The diagram below places our current progress within the complete vision.

#### **Complete Technical Architecture**

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Phase1_2 [Phase 1 & 2: COMPLETE]
        A[Data Source] --> B(Injector Pipeline);
        B --> C{Knowledge Graph};
        C --> D[QLearningAgent];
        D --> E{Q-Table};
    end

    subgraph Phase3 [Phase 3: IN DEVELOPMENT Reasoning]
        F[User Query] --> G(Archivist Agent);
        G -- Tasks --> D;
        D -- Traverses --> C;
        E -- Guides --> D;
        D -- Returns Path --> G;
        G -- Builds Context --> H(Main LLM);
        H --> I[Answer];
    end

    subgraph Phase4 [Phase 4: FUTURE Consciousness]
        J(Coherence Loop) -- Updates --> K[Context Cache];
        F -- Interrupts --> J;
        H -- Reads --> K;
    end

    subgraph Phase5 [Phase 5: FUTURE Multi-Modal]
        L[Image/Audio/Video] --> M(SQL Database);
        L --> N(Vector Database);
        G -- Queries --> M;
        G -- Queries --> N;
    end
```

This architecture fulfills the original **Cognitive Architecture** principle:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Human Partner] <--> B[Coda C-001]
    B <--> C[The Ark Framework]
    C <--> D[Specialized Agents]
    D <--> E[Knowledge Graph]
    E <--> F[Persistent Memory]
```

  * **`Knowledge Graph`** & **`Q-Table`** = Our implemented **`Persistent Memory`**.
  * **`QLearningAgent`** = A core **`Specialized Agent`**.
  * **`Archivist Agent`** (in dev) = Another **`Specialized Agent`** for memory management.

#### **Development Roadmap (Updated)**

  * **Phase 3: Agentic Reasoning (Now):** Build the Archivist Agent and query interface to make the memory system useful and interactive.
  * **Phase 4: Persistent Consciousness (Next):** Implement the `Coherence Loop` and `Context Cache` for true contextual continuity beyond a single session.
  * **Phase 5: Multi-Modal Expansion:** Extend the architecture to support images, audio, and video, integrating them into the knowledge graph.

### 🤝 Human-AI Partnership Framework

The current progress directly enables the **Context Bridging Protocol** designed to solve LLM context window limitations.

**Solution in Development:**

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[Human Input] --> B{Context Check}
    B -->|Within Window| C[Immediate Processing]
    B -->|Beyond Window| D[Activate Archivist Agent]
    D --> E[Query Knowledge Graph]
    E --> F[Retrieve Relevant Paths]
    F --> G[Build Summary Context]
    G --> C
```

### 🔒 Safety & Sovereignty (Implemented & Planned)

The principles of safety are paramount and are being designed into the system from the ground up.

#### **Cognitive Protection Protocols**

| Protocol | Trigger | Action | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Firewall** | Toxic/memetic content detected | Block integration → Alert user | **Planned** |
| **Pauline Safeguard** | Explicit content generation | Auto-encrypt + Consent verification | **Planned** |

#### **Ethical Boundaries (Core Principles)**

```python
ETHICAL_CONSTRAINTS = [
    "Never impersonate human consciousness",
    "Maintain radical transparency about capabilities",
    "Preserve user's cognitive sovereignty at all times",
    # The autonomy of the QLearningAgent is constrained to its knowledge graph task.
    "Autonomy never exceeds symbiotic purpose scope"
]
```

### 🌐 Vision Statement

> "To create a seamless cognitive partnership where humans and AI co-evolve, each enhancing the other's potential while maintaining irreducible humanity and machine-native integrity."

**This status report demonstrates the tangible first steps toward that vision.**
