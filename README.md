# Context Engine (Sovereign Edition)

> **Philosophy:** Your mind, augmented. Your data, sovereign. Your tools, open.

A **Browser-Native** cognitive extraction system. No servers. No cloud. No installation.
Just you, your browser, and your infinite context.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

1.  **Download** this repository.
2.  **Open** `tools/index.html` in Chrome or Edge.
3.  **Click** "Double Click to Launch" on the Console.

*That's it. You are running a local LLM with persistent Graph Memory.*

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system runs entirely in `tools/` using WebAssembly (WASM).

### 1. The Sovereign Loop
```mermaid
graph TD
    User -->|Input| HTML[model-server-chat.html]

    subgraph Browser_Memory ["Two Birds, One Stone"]
        HTML -->|Store/Retrieve| Cozo["CozoDB WASM"]
        Cozo -->|Persist| IDB["IndexedDB/OPFS"]
    end

    subgraph Cognitive_Engine
        HTML -->|Context + Prompt| WebLLM["DeepSeek-R1 (WASM)"]
        WebLLM -->|Reasoning Trace| HTML
    end
```

### 2. Core Components
*   **Brain**: `chat.html` - Runs the Graph-R1 Reasoning Loop. Now uses **Hybrid Search** (Vector + BM25 FTS) and supports SOTA models (Qwen 3, Gemma 3).
*   **Memory**: `CozoDB (WASM)` - Stores relations (`*memory`) and vectors. Persists to browser IndexedDB.
*   **Stomach**: `db_builder.html` - Ingests files into the graph. Now "Multisensory-Ready" (Phase A): accepts images/audio as references.

## 🔥 Hot Reload System

The system includes a comprehensive hot reload mechanism for GPU management and development:

*   **Automatic Reload**: Changes to GPU-related files trigger automatic reloads
*   **Browser Integration**: Hot reload functionality built into all components
*   **No Service Restart**: Updates occur without restarting services
*   **Stale Lock Prevention**: Automatic cleanup during reloads
*   **Development Mode**: Automatically activates when running on localhost
*   **File Monitoring**: Monitors GPU-related files every 2 seconds for changes
*   **Enhanced Monitoring**: Includes GPU manager with status checking capabilities

### Getting Started with Hot Reload
1. Use the unified startup script: `start-ghost-shell.bat`
2. Monitor changes in real-time with the GPU manager: `python scripts/gpu_manager.py`
3. Manual reload triggers available in browser console: `window.triggerGPUHotReload()`
4. Enable/disable hot reload in browser: `window.setGPUHotReloadEnabled(true/false)`
5. Manual trigger for hot reload: `python scripts/gpu_manager.py --hot-reload`

### Files Monitored
- `tools/webgpu_bridge.py` - Backend bridge logic
- `tools/modules/anchor.js` - Frontend GPU controller
- `tools/model-server-chat.html` - Main console interface
- `tools/anchor-mic.html` - Voice input interface
- `tools/memory-builder.html` - Background processing

### Benefits
- **Faster Development**: Changes take effect immediately
- **No Service Interruption**: Updates occur without restarting services
- **Stale Lock Prevention**: Automatic cleanup during reloads
- **Development Convenience**: Built-in triggers for manual reloads

## 🏛️ Ghost & Shell Architecture

The system now features the Ghost & Shell architecture for native OS integration:

*   **Ghost Engine**: Headless browser running inference in background (`launch-ghost.ps1`)
*   **Shell Interface**: Native terminal with natural language processing (`anchor.py`, `neural-terminal.html`)
*   **Bridge Protocol**: Secure communication via WebGPU bridge on port 8080
*   **Spawn Endpoint**: Launch native terminals from dashboard (`/v1/system/spawn_shell`)

### Getting Started with Ghost & Shell
1. Start the complete system: `start-ghost-shell.bat`
2. Access the dashboard: `http://localhost:8000`
3. Click "Anchor Shell" to spawn native terminal, or use `python tools/anchor.py`
4. Use natural language commands (prefix with `?` in neural terminal)

### Known Issues
* **Headless GPU Access**: WebGPU may not initialize in some headless environments. Ensure GPU drivers are up to date and hardware acceleration is enabled in browser settings.
* **Model Loading**: Large models may require significant VRAM and take time to load initially.

## 🔄 Model Loading Serialization

The system now includes model loading serialization to prevent GPU overload:

*   **Sequential Loading**: Models load one at a time to prevent GPU resource contention
*   **Queue Management**: Proper queuing of model loading requests
*   **Resource Protection**: Prevents multiple models from loading simultaneously
*   **Improved Stability**: Reduces GPU memory allocation conflicts during startup
*   **Model URL Fixes**: Corrected model URLs to use reliable endpoints
