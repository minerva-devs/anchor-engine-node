## [2.0.1] - 2025-12-30 "Server Stability & Endpoint Fixes"

### Fixed
- **Server Startup Issues**: Resolved server hanging issues caused by problematic path parameter syntax (`:path`) in route definitions that prevented proper server startup
- **Missing Endpoints**: Added critical missing endpoints (`/v1/models/pull`, `/v1/models/pull/status`, `/v1/gpu/lock`, `/v1/gpu/status`, etc.) that were documented but missing from implementation
- **Endpoint Accessibility**: Verified all documented endpoints are now accessible and responding properly
- **Model Availability**: Improved model availability testing showing that `Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC` and `Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC` have most files available (missing only `params.json`)

### Architecture Shift
- **Unified Anchor Core**: Consolidated Bridge, File Server, and UI into a single process (`webgpu_bridge.py`) running on **Port 8000**.
- **Single Origin**: Eliminated CORS issues and port confusion. UI, API, and Models are served from the same origin.
- **Protocol**:
    - Brain: `http://localhost:8000/chat.html`
    - Terminal: `http://localhost:8000/terminal.html`
    - API: `http://localhost:8000/v1/...`

### Removed / Archived
